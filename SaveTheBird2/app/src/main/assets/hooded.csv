Everything one could hope for was there; perfect overcast lighting for dramatic photos, a cool that was bracing but not unpleasant, the beautiful blond rabbits of Golf Course Point... and even my first ever sighting of a Lizard for Orielton, a beautiful and very obliging Eastern Three-Lined Skink on one of the little logs by the Skylarks paddock! The only major detractor was the sheer skittishness of the Waders, of which so many kinds of so many individuals were present that the mind boggles! I had to go out past the Gull Colony, back to the Golf Course, back past the Gull Colony, and even wade, as the Waders all were, to escape the incredibly irritating attentions of the furious Kelp Gulls!! Oh, the Waders... Golden Plovers, Stints, Sharpies, Godwits... even Curlews at last returned to us, and the beautiful Pec!!! But the highlight? The astonishing highlight? Not only was it a first for me at Orielton, and one of the most appealing of all Waders, but it was the available records indicate that this gem was a FIRST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF ORIELTON!!!","This was absolutely the last thing I expected to find on my expedition out past the Gull Colony! I was photographing a fine flock of Red Caps, all of which were scurrying and halting in the nervous manner of their kind, when I suddenly noticed a different, larger bird pottering around behind them, slow yet never stopping, picking daintily at the mud! So big and pale was it that I knew something bizarre was afoot, even with only the first second of my view... and then I saw that head, that pitch black head, and the eye ring shockingly red! It was, in the usual manner of its kind, perfectly contented with being cautiously approached, albeit while seeming deeply confused and disorientated... as well it might! I don't mind saying I actually cursed out loud, such was my shock; after all, not only was this the first Hoodie I've ever seen at Orielton, a real favourite bird at my favourite site, and a Hoodie as far from its usual habitat as one can really hope to see, but according to the available records this bird was THE FIRST EVER HOODED PLOVER IN ORIELTON HISTORY!!
